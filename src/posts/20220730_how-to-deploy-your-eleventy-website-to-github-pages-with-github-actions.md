I've been thinking about starting my own blog for several years now. I kept putting it off, but a few weeks ago I finally got to it.
In this article, I explain how to set up a skeleton Eleventy website, push it to GitHub and with the help of GitHub Actions publish it on GitHub Pages.

> This article assumes you have GitHub account and a basic knowledge of executing NPM and Git commands in your terminal.

Before I started on the development I made a list of requirements:

- create a fully static website
- be able to write my blogs in markdown
- host it on GitHub Pages
- use GitHub Actions for CI/CD

So after evaluating a few static site generators I picked Eleventy. The reason I'm using a static site generator is because it generates a full static HTML website. This has a positive impact on the performance of the website, plus there is no need for a backend or database.

## The basic setup

Create a new folder and initialize it with the following command.
This creates a `package.json` file in your directory.

```bash
npm init -y
```

For now, I'm going to stick to the bare minimum for this setup. In a follow-up blog post I'll be adding some extra features.

```bash
npm install @11ty/eleventy@latest sass@latest --save-exact
```

After the packages are installed, open the `package.json` file and add these commands inside the `scripts` tag.

```bash
"watch:sass": "sass src/static/scss:public/static/css --watch",
"build:sass": "sass src/static/scss:public/static/css",
"watch:eleventy": "eleventy --serve",
"build:eleventy": "ELEVENTY_ENV=development eleventy",
"start": "npm run watch:eleventy & npm run watch:sass",
"build": "npm run build:eleventy & npm run build:sass"
```

To be able to run our [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) skeleton we need to add a few things first.
Create the following folder structure.

- src
  - \_includes
  - static
    - scss

When you've done that, create a `.eleventy.js` file in the root folder and give it this content.

```js
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.setBrowserSyncConfig({
    files: './public/static/**/*.css',
  });

  return {
    dir: {
      input: 'src',
      output: 'public',
    },
  };
};
```

The `.eleventy.js` file is where all the configuration is done. Here we'll also define things like [filters](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/), add [plugins](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/), etc...
The current configuration reloads the website whenever a change is made to our `scss`. Secondly, the compiled `scss` output is served in the `public/static/css` folder.

Now let's add the last 3 files so we can get up and running. First create a file called `main.scss` and put it in the `static/scss` folder.
Secondly create a template file called `base.njk` and put it in the `_includes` folder, you can give it the content below.

> Eleventy has built-in support for the [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templating language.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {% block content %} {{ content | safe }} {% endblock %}
  </body>
</html>
```

Lastly add a `index.md` file in the `src` folder with this content and run the `npm run start` command in your terminal.

```markdown
---
layout: 'base.njk'
permalink: /
title: 'My Eleventy Website'
---

# Hello World!
```

The output in your terminal should look like this.

![Eleventy build terminal output](/static/images/posts/build-output-terminal.jpg)

Open a browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`, it should show `Hello World!` on the page.
To make sure that the styling of our website is properly rendered lets modify the `base.njk` by adding the `url` to our stylesheet inside the `<head>` tag.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ 'static/css/main.css' | url }}" media="screen" />
```

Let's do something crazy and add this to `main.scss` and go back to the browser to see the result.
Because of `setBrowserSyncConfig` in our `config` the browser should automatically refresh.

```scss
h1 {
  color: orange;
  background-color: darkblue;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

## Push our code to GitHub

First create a `.gitignore` file in the root folder, so we don't push unnecessary files to the repository.

```bash
# Dependencies
/node_modules

# Misc
/public

# Intellij
/.idea

# Sass
.sass-cache/
*.css.map
*.sass.map
*.scss.map

# Visual Studio Code
/.vscode
.history
```

Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository called `my-eleventy-website`.
Don't add a `README`, `.gitignore` and `LICENCE`, they should be unselected by default.

![GitHub settings tab](/static/images/posts/github-create-repository.jpg)

Go into the root folder of your project and perform the following commands. Make sure to adjust the parts between `{{ ... }}`

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M {{ your default branch }}
git remote add origin https://github.com/{{your-github-username}}/my-eleventy-website.git
git push -u origin {{ your default branch }}
```

## Setup GitHub Pages

Alright, now that our repository is created we can enable GitHub Pages. Go to the page of the repository you've just created and click on the settings button in the top right.

Click on the Pages button and select your default branch in the dropdown, probably this is `main` or `master`, leave `/(root)` as the selected folder. Click on `save` to confirm the settings.

![GitHub settings tab](/static/images/posts/github-pages-setup.jpg)

Once you've done this a message should appear with the URL where your website is published.

## Build your website with GitHub Actions

By default, GitHub pages uses Jekyll to generate your website. In our case we're using Eleventy, so we want to inform GitHub Pages about this. To do this, create an empty file called `.nojekyll` and put it in the root directory.

Next create `.github` folder also in the root directory and inside that folder create another folder called `workflows`. In this folder we put the workflows which are executed by GitHub Actions.

We're going to create 2 workflows, the first one performs a build when a pull request is created.
Create a file with the name `build.yml`. If your default branch is something other than `main` make sure to change this in the `branches` array.

This workflow only performs a build and not yet deploy your changes. This way there is a fail-safe solution.

```yaml
name: Build on PR

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: ['14.17.6']

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install packages
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run npm build
        run: npm run build
```

Next create `build-and-deploy.yml`. As the name of the file already suggests, this workflow builds and deploys our website to GitHub Pages when a `push` is done on `main` branch, for example when you merge a PR.

```yaml
name: Build & Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: ['14.17.6']

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install packages
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run npm build
        run: npm run build:prod

      - name: Deploy to gh-pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY }}
```

Before we can use this workflow we'll need to create an `ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY`. This key is needed to be able to deploy our generated code to GitHub Pages.
Follow the steps that are described in these docs to create an [ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#%EF%B8%8F-create-ssh-deploy-key).

Now let's add extra commands to our `scripts` property in the `package.json` file when running our build on GitHub.

```bash
"build:sass:prod": "sass src/static/scss:public/static/css --style compressed",
"build:eleventy:prod": "ELEVENTY_ENV=production eleventy",
"build:prod": "npm run build:eleventy:prod & npm run build:sass"
```

Once that is done we can push all the changes to our repository and let the magic happen!

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "build and deploy"
git push
```

Now head over to your repository on GitHub and click on the `Actions` tab on top. Normally you should see the `Build & Deploy` workflow being executed, once that is done another workflow called `pages-build-deployment` is triggered and deploys the generated website to GitHub Pages.

![GitHub actions tab](/static/images/posts/github-actions.jpg)

After the `Build & Deploy` workflow is executed a new branch called `gh-pages` is auto-created. In this branch the generated output of your Eleventy site will be stored. To be able to host the website properly we need to inform GitHub Pages about this. Navigate to the Settings tab and select Pages in the list on the left. Change the branch
from which your GitHub Pages site is currently being built to `gh-pages` and hit `save`.

![GitHub Pages settings repository](/static/images/posts/github-settings-gh-pages-repository.jpg)

The `pages-build-deployment` workflow will be automatically triggered again and after it has finished you can navigate to the URL where your website is published to see the final result. You've done it!
